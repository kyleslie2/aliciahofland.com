Statement:

Through a variety of painting and drawing materials,  I explore the flaws in our own personal experiences of memory, and how those transgressions are doubled within a relationship. The patchiness of recalling our pasts become woven together, creating an atmosphere by the combined narratives exchanged within the relationship. By focusing on the role memory plays within my own long term relationships, I point to the universal experience of the endlessly changing past, the importance our relationships have on those reflections, and how our changing memory is expressed in our perception of the future.
